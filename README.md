# Assessment and Treatment Notes
This repo is created to store notes on my son's milestones and in general autism therapy techniques. <br> This can help us in giving better care to my son 
who is diagnosed as high risk for ASD [diagnosed when he was 18 months]. <br>We are intervening early to make him as independent as possible while he grows up.
<br>
<br>
The areas we are focusing on are: <br>
- Behavioural Skills <br>
- Communication Skills (Expressive and Receptive) <br>
- Social Skills <br>
